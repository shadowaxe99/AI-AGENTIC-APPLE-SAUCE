We give you a full cloud environment that's sandboxed. That means:
- Access to Linux OS
- Using filesystem (create, list, and delete files and dirs)
- Run processes
- Sandboxed - you can run any code
- Access to the internet

These cloud instances are meant to be used for agents. Like a sandboxed playgrounds, where the agent can do whatever it wants.

## Development
Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Then start reloading server by running:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## What is e2b?
[E2B](https://www.e2b.dev/) is the company behind this repo. We're building an operating system for AI agents. A set of low-level APIs for building agents (debugging, auth, monitor, and more) together with sandboxed cloud environments for the agents where the agents can roam freely without barriers 🐎.
